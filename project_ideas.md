This will be a collection of ideas for my Capstone projects. I will later narrow this down and determine which idea to pursue further.

My initial thought is a database of some kind. I have a keen interest in Gaming and Tabletop. So perhaps something related to that.

Idea 1- A site where you can register and track what Tabletop and Board games you have played, owned, or are looking to play. perhaps with functionality to find others in your area that have similar interests based on prior game history and future game interests.

Idea 2- A site for game ratings. Submit your ratings on board/video games you have played and view other ratings on those games. The site would also compile a list of potential matches for games you may like based on your ratings of other games.

Idea 3- A site for finding and comparing game prices at multiple retailers. A way to find good games cheap.
