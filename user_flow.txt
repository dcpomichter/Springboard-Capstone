On the Login page the user can login, or if they do not have a Login, they can Register a new account. If the user is Registering a new account it will take them through a number of registration pages to gather both user personal data and begin their collection of registered games. Once logged in the system will check for the previous page, if the previous page was an article, or specific game review it will re-route to that page with the user logged in, otherwise it will default to the users Profile page.
